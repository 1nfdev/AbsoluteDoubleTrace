## Please read:
At the moment I currently don't have much time to work on Trace, I am aware of the issues that have been raised and will get updates out to address them as soon as I have the time to do so. This is only temporary and I will be doing more work on Trace in the future.

**[Changelog](https://absolutedouble.co.uk/trace/information.html) | [FAQ](https://absolutedouble.co.uk/trace/faq.html) | [Privacy Policy](https://absolutedouble.co.uk/trace/privacy.html) | [Telegram Channel](https://t.me/trace_extension)**

This will have the source code of every major release.
